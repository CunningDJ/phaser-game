# Phaser.js Experiment

## Intro
This will be my first experimentation with the Phaser.js framework.  I'll first play with the basics and refactoring the code for optimal physics customization, and then expand from there.

## Phase 1
I created the basic tutorial setup found (here)[].  I then refactored to allow for walk speed and run factor globals, adjusting the gravity and other physics and added a run capability.  I also swapped out my own image of the sky made from a screenshot of a linear-gradient.
